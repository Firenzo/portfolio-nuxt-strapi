The interface is easy and logical to use. In addition, the program is also quite light, which is very nice when you work with animations. I have not seen any stuttering images whatsoever. Importing Sketch files is also very smooth, but there are a few things to keep in mind when importing a Sketch file, in which I encountered some frustrations.",p2:"When importing a sketch file, only the visible layers are included in Principle. And because Principle looks at the property differences of each layer between screen A and screen B, this means that all layers must actually be present in screen A and screen B. So if you transition between two completely different screens, your design will look very messy. Below such an example.",img1:{path:as,image:"messy-screen-a.jpg",classList:"hmd-messy-screen-a rounded-corners shadow",aspectRatio:at,imageDescription:"View in Principle for Screen A"},img2:{path:as,image:"messy-screen-b.jpg",classList:"hmd-messy-screen-b rounded-corners shadow",aspectRatio:at,imageDescription:"View in Principle for Screen B"},p3:"The layers of screens A and B must also have the same folder structure. And doing all of that properly takes time and effort. I had a lot of trouble with that in the beginning, but in the end it became easier. After importing it is just a matter of giving all unnecessary layers an opacity of 0 and changing the position for a nice animation when the layer appears.",p4:"Another frustration in Principle is that you cannot change certain things after importing a Sketch file. For example, I found out that I made a typo, but I had already started animating. To get rid of this typo I had to edit the Sketch file and import it again. Because of this I had to do the animations all over again. The reason that you can no longer change texts, colors, etc. is because Principle creates a bitmap image of every layer, with the exception of vectors. It can be useful to work with vectors as much as possible, but to save a simple rectangle or text as a vector file and then import it into Principle also takes a lot of time.",h3a:"Will I keep using Principle?",p5:"Maybe.",p6:"Principle is a nice application, but not quite what I was looking for. I thought importing Sketch files would be a great feature. Ok well... it's a great feature, but the things that come with it such as the correct setup of all layers etc., I don't really like that and it also takes a lot of time and effort. It is also very annoying if you cannot make small changes to the design while you are animating.",p7:"Therefore I prefer creating animations to be implemented in a design application such as Sketch. I know that Invision Studio works almost like Sketch and you can add animations in this application too. In addition, Framer is also a very powerful application, where almost everything is possible, because you can run your designs partly on code. These are two applications that are very interesting to try out. Since I already have some affinity with writing code, I think it would be more fun to try out Framer. After trying this application, I can make a better comparison and pick one."},sliders:[{sliderId:"homeMonitoringDashboardWireframes",type:j,hasHeader:c,hasSubHeader:b,hasFooter:b,scaleFactor:[a,a,a,q,f,f],contentData:[{slideId:a,title:au,imageFolder:y,image:"home-screen.jpg",aspectRatio:"1040\u002F769"},{slideId:k,title:av,imageFolder:y,image:"light-screen.jpg",aspectRatio:"1040\u002F770"},{slideId:l,title:aw,imageFolder:y,image:"mail-screen.jpg",aspectRatio:"1040\u002F765"},{slideId:s,title:ax,imageFolder:y,image:"music-screen.jpg",aspectRatio:"1040\u002F761"}]},{sliderId:"homeMonitoringDashboardVisuals",type:j,hasHeader:c,hasSubHeader:b,hasFooter:b,scaleFactor:[a,a,a,q,f,f],contentData:[{slideId:a,title:au,imageFolder:z,image:"home-screen.png",aspectRatio:A},{slideId:k,title:av,imageFolder:z,image:"light-screen.png",aspectRatio:A},{slideId:l,title:aw,imageFolder:z,image:"mail-screen.png",aspectRatio:A},{slideId:s,title:ax,imageFolder:z,image:"music-screen.png",aspectRatio:A}]}]}},{projectName:M,projectPageTitle:M,tags:[m,E],image:"beatid.jpg",imageAlt:M,pageLayout:"\u003Cp\u003EA concept for an app made for music producers.
