Importing Sketch files is also very smooth, but there are a few things to keep in mind when importing a Sketch file, in which I encountered some frustrations.",p2:"When importing a sketch file, only the visible layers are included in Principle. And because Principle looks at the property differences of each layer between screen A and screen B, this means that all layers must actually be present in screen A and screen B. So if you transition between two completely different screens, your design will look very messy.

And doing all of that properly takes time and effort. I had a lot of trouble with that in the beginning, but in the end it became easier. After importing it is just a matter of giving all unnecessary layers an opacity of 0 and changing the position for a nice animation when the layer appears.",p4:"Another frustration in Principle is that you cannot change certain things after importing a Sketch file. For example, I found out that I made a typo, but I had already started animating. To get rid of this typo I had to edit the Sketch file and import it again. Because of this I had to do the animations all over again. The reason that you can no longer change texts, colors, etc. is because Principle creates a bitmap image of every layer, with the exception of vectors. It can be useful to work with vectors as much as possible, but to save a simple rectangle or text as a vector file and then import it into Principle also takes a lot of time.",h3a:"Will I keep using Principle?",p5:"Maybe.",p6:"Principle is a nice application, but not quite what I was looking for. I thought importing Sketch files would be a great feature. Ok well... it's a great feature, but the things that come with it such as the correct setup of all layers etc., I don't really like that and it also takes a lot of time and effort. It is also very annoying if you cannot make small changes to the design while you are animating.",p7:"Therefore I prefer creating animations to be implemented in a design application such as Sketch. I know that Invision Studio works almost like Sketch and you can add animations in this application too. In addition, Framer is also a very powerful application, where almost everything is possible, because you can run your designs partly on code. These are two applications that are very interesting to try out. Since I already have some affinity with writing code, I think it would be more fun to try out Framer.
